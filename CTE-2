Here is a more complex CTE:

WITH user_count_country AS
(
	SELECT D.country
	, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS user_count
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B 
	ON A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C 
	ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D 
	ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
	group bY country
	ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
)

, top_5_by_country AS
(

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS top_user_count
    , country
    FROM
    (
    SELECT A.customer_id AS "customer_id"
	, SUM(A.amount) AS "sum_amount_paid"
	, B.first_name AS "first_name"
	, B.last_name AS "last_name"
	, D.city AS "city"
	, E.country AS "country"
	, AVG(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id=C.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D. city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
	WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country  
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5
    ) A
    GROUP BY country
)

SELECT A.*
, CASE WHEN b.top_user_count IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE b.top_user_count END AS top_user_count
FROM user_count_country A
LEFT JOIN top_5_by_country B
ON A.country=B.country;
